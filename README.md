TypeScript cheatsheet and notes

### What is TypeScript?
- TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types,  and some additional features like generics, interface etc.
- TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. 
- TypeScript is a Object-Oriented programming.
- TypeScript Code is converted into Plain JavaScript Code:
 TypeScript code can’t be natively interpreted by browsers. So if the code was written in TypeScript, it gets compiled and converted into JavaScript before execution.
